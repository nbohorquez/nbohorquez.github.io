I develop numerical methods to solve difficult control problems that we face in
humanoid robotics: nonlinearities and redundancy. I am interested in being able
to compute solutions to these problems about as **fast** as bees flap their
wings (which is around 5[ms] or 60 times faster than the blink of an eye) so we
can make robots jump, climb trees, run and execute other **highly dynamic
motions**.

At the same time, I am interested in the way these motions are shaped by user
command and context.  Robots should have the same sort of **avatar
intelligence** that videogame characters have about their virtual worlds and
that allows them to smoothly move around and interact. In reality, I just want
to have a monkey robot and play with it.

I live in the beautiful French Alps and work everyday with a talented team of
roboticists: Matteo Ciocca, Nahuel Villa, Alexis Mifsud, Adrien Pajon and Pu
Zheng. All lead by the brilliant and sharp-minded Pierre-Brice Wieber.
